Introduction 
========================================================

- Eartquakes are a shaking of the earth surface produced by the movement of tectonic plates. Some are not even felt, and some cause great damage to public health and economy. Only data from the latter are included here. 

- Curious about where the most destructive earthquakes have happened between the years 1951 and 2016?     
  - This app shows the exact date, magnitude, and location of quakes per region and year.
  - It also provides the total number of destructive earthquakes registered per region and year.


A look into the source data
